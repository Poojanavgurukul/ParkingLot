# ParkingSpot
There is a Parking lot: which has 20 Parking spots
And assume only there are three types of vehicles, which are main.java.parkingLot.Bike, main.java.parkingLot.Car, main.java.parkingLot.Bus

main.java.parkingLot.Bike needs 1 spots
main.java.parkingLot.Car need 2 spots
main.java.parkingLot.Bus needs 4 Spots

When ever some vehicles comes, before parking, it has to check is there any free spot, and can it park there or not based on its size
Parking lot has to keep track of the number of spots whenever vehicles parks and unparks
